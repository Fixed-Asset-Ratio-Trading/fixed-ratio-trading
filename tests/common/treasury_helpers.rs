//! # Treasury State Verification Helpers
//!
//! **PHASE 2.1 MILESTONE 2.2**: Treasury State Verification Helpers
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive treasury state verification and comparison
//! utilities for testing treasury operations, consolidations, and state changes.
//!
//! Key Features:
//! - Treasury state retrieval and validation
//! - Counter increment verification for different operation types
//! - Treasury balance change verification
//! - Comprehensive state comparison with detailed deltas
//! - Mock data support for reliable infrastructure testing
