//! Fee Management Processors
//! 
//! This module contains all the processors for fee-related operations including
//! fee withdrawals, fee configuration, and fee collection management.
//!
//! ## Fee Types Overview
//! 
//! The Fixed Ratio Trading system implements two distinct fee types:
//!
//! ### 1. Contract Fees (Fixed SOL amounts)
//! - **Pool Creation**: 1.15 SOL per pool creation
//! - **Liquidity Operations**: 0.0013 SOL per deposit/withdrawal  
//! - **Swaps**: 0.00002715 SOL per swap transaction
//! - **Purpose**: Cover operational costs and prevent spam
//! - **Collection**: Automatically transferred to pool state PDA
//! - **Withdrawal**: Via `process_withdraw_fees()` by pool owner
//!
//! ### 2. Pool Fees (Percentage-based on tokens)
//! - **Rate**: 0% to 0.5% configurable by pool owner
//! - **Default**: 0% (free trading by default)
//! - **Application**: Deducted from input tokens during swaps
//! - **Purpose**: Revenue generation for pool operators
//! - **Collection**: Tracked in pool state (`collected_fees_token_a`, `collected_fees_token_b`)
//! - **Withdrawal**: Via `process_withdraw_pool_fees()` by pool owner

/// Processes **Contract Fee** withdrawals by the pool owner.
///
/// This function allows the pool owner to withdraw accumulated **SOL fees** (contract fees) 
/// collected from pool operations. These are the fixed SOL amounts charged for:
/// - Pool creation (1.15 SOL)
/// - Deposits/withdrawals (0.0013 SOL each)  
/// - Swaps (0.00002715 SOL each)
///
/// The withdrawal maintains rent-exempt status by ensuring sufficient SOL remains in the 
/// pool state account. Only the designated pool owner can execute SOL fee withdrawals.
///
/// **Note**: This function handles SOL fees only. For SPL token fee withdrawals (pool fees),
/// use `process_withdraw_pool_fees()`.
///
/// # Purpose
/// - Enables pool owner to collect accumulated SOL fees for operational costs
/// - Maintains pool rent-exempt status during fee collection
/// - Provides transparent fee withdrawal mechanism with logging
/// - Supports sustainable pool operations through fee collection
/// - Ensures only authorized pool owner can access collected fees
///
/// # How it works
/// 1. Validates the caller is the designated pool owner and signed the transaction
/// 2. Loads current pool state data to verify ownership and calculate available fees
/// 3. Calculates available fees by subtracting rent-exempt minimum from pool balance
/// 4. Transfers available SOL fees directly from pool state PDA to owner account
/// 5. Uses direct lamport transfer for PDA accounts
/// 6. Logs fee withdrawal amount for transparency and audit compliance
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `_program_id` - The program ID (currently unused but reserved for validation)
/// * `accounts` - Array of account infos in the following order:
///   - `accounts[0]` - Pool owner account (must be signer and match pool state owner)
///   - `accounts[1]` - Pool state PDA account (source of fees, must have sufficient balance)
///   - `accounts[2]` - System program (required for SOL transfers)
///   - `accounts[3]` - Rent sysvar (for rent-exempt calculations)
///   - `accounts[4]` - Clock sysvar (for rent tracking and timestamps)
///
/// # Account Requirements
/// - Owner: Must be signer and match the owner field in pool state data
/// - Pool state: Must be the valid pool state PDA with sufficient SOL balance
/// - System program: Standard Solana system program for SOL transfers
///
/// # Fee Calculation
/// - Available fees = Total pool state balance - Rent-exempt minimum
/// - Rent-exempt minimum calculated using current rent rates and account size
/// - Zero fees available indicates all SOL is reserved for rent exemption
///
/// # Security Features
/// - **Ownership validation**: Only the designated pool owner can withdraw fees
/// - **Rent protection**: Always maintains minimum balance for rent exemption
/// - **Direct lamport transfer**: Uses safe lamport transfer for PDA accounts
/// - **Transparency**: Logs all fee withdrawals for audit trail
///
/// # Errors
/// - `ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature` - Owner didn't sign transaction
/// - `ProgramError::InvalidAccountData` - Caller is not the pool owner
/// - `ProgramError::ArithmeticOverflow` - Mathematical calculation errors
///
/// # Example Usage
/// ```ignore
/// // Pool owner withdraws accumulated SOL fees
/// let instruction = PoolInstruction::WithdrawFees;
/// // Transfers: pool_balance - rent_minimum ‚Üí owner_account
/// ```
///
/// # Note
/// This function only handles SOL fees. For SPL token fee withdrawals, use
/// `process_withdraw_pool_fees()`.
