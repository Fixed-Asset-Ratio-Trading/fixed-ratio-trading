//! Security Management Processors

//! This module contains all the processors for security-related operations including
//! security parameter updates, pause/unpause functionality, and risk management controls.

/// Updates the pool's security parameters to manage operational risk and compliance.
///
/// This function allows the pool owner to modify critical security settings that control
/// pool operations. Currently focused on pause/unpause functionality, with extensibility
/// for future security parameters. This provides emergency controls and operational 
/// flexibility for pool management.
///
/// # Purpose
/// - Provides emergency stop capability through pause functionality
/// - Enables dynamic security policy adjustments based on market conditions
/// - Allows compliance with regulatory requirements or protocol upgrades
/// - Maintains operational control for pool owners while protecting user funds
/// - Supports future expansion of security features and risk management
///
/// # How it works
/// 1. Validates the caller is the designated pool owner and signed the transaction
/// 2. Loads current pool state data to verify ownership permissions
/// 3. Applies any provided security parameter updates:
///    - `is_paused`: Immediately enables/disables pool operations
/// 4. Serializes updated pool state back to on-chain storage
/// 5. Logs changes for transparency and audit compliance
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `_program_id` - The program ID (currently unused, reserved for future validation)
/// * `accounts` - Array of account infos in the following order:
///   - `accounts[0]` - Pool owner account (must be signer and match pool state owner)
///   - `accounts[1]` - Pool state PDA account (writable for parameter updates)
/// * `is_paused` - Optional boolean to pause/unpause all pool operations (except owner functions)
///
/// # Account Requirements
/// - Owner: Must be signer and match the owner field in pool state data
/// - Pool state: Must be writable for parameter updates
///
/// # Pause Functionality
/// When `is_paused = true`:
/// - Blocks all user operations: deposits, withdrawals, swaps
/// - Allows owner operations: fee withdrawals, security updates, delegate management
/// - Provides emergency stop for security incidents or maintenance
/// - Can be reversed by setting `is_paused = false`
///
/// # Security Features
/// - **Owner-only access**: Only designated pool owner can modify security parameters
/// - **Selective enforcement**: Pause affects user operations but preserves owner controls
/// - **Immediate effect**: Parameter changes take effect in the same transaction
/// - **Audit trail**: All parameter changes are logged for transparency
///
/// # Future Extensions
/// The reserved parameters enable future security enhancements:
/// - Rate limiting for various operations
/// - Dynamic fee adjustments based on market conditions
///
/// # Errors
/// - `ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature` - Owner didn't sign transaction
/// - `ProgramError::InvalidAccountData` - Caller is not the pool owner
///
/// # Example Usage
/// ```ignore
/// // Emergency pause all pool operations
/// let instruction = PoolInstruction::UpdateSecurityParams {
///     is_paused: Some(true),          // Pause operations
/// };
///
/// // Resume normal operations
/// let instruction = PoolInstruction::UpdateSecurityParams {
///     is_paused: Some(false),         // Unpause operations
/// };
/// ```
