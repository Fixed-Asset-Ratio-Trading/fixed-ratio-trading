    /// **CRITICAL**: Program-level initialization (MUST BE CALLED FIRST)
    /// 
    /// This instruction must be called once when the program is first deployed.
    /// It creates all the system-level infrastructure that individual pools depend on.
    /// 
    /// # What it creates:
    /// 1. SystemState PDA - Global pause controls and system authority
    /// 2. MainTreasury PDA - Pool creation and liquidity operation fees
    /// 3. SwapTreasury PDA - Regular swap fees (high frequency)
    /// 4. HftTreasury PDA - HFT swap fees (high frequency)
    /// 
    /// # When to call:
    /// - ONCE during initial program deployment
    /// - Before any pools can be created
    /// - Before any other program operations
    /// 
    /// # After this initialization:
    /// - Pool creation will have treasury PDAs to send fees to
    /// - System pause functionality will be available
    /// - Treasury management operations will work
    /// - All subsequent operations will assume these PDAs exist
    /// 
    /// # Arguments:
    /// - `system_authority`: The pubkey that will control system-wide operations
    ///   (pause/unpause system, withdraw treasury funds, etc.)
    /// 
    /// # Security:
    /// - Can only be called once (fails if SystemState already exists)
    /// - Creates all accounts as PDAs owned by the program
    /// - Sets up proper rent exemption for all accounts
    InitializeProgram {
        system_authority: Pubkey,
    },

    /// **RECOMMENDED**: Single-instruction pool initialization
    /// 
    /// This instruction provides a single, atomic operation for pool creation.
    /// 
    /// # What it does:
    /// - Creates Pool State PDA with correct size allocation
    /// - Creates LP token mints and transfers authority to pool
    /// - Creates token vault PDAs and initializes them
    /// - Initializes pool state data with all configuration
    /// - Transfers registration fees
    /// 
    /// # Benefits:
    /// - Atomic operation (all-or-nothing)
    /// - Simpler client integration
    /// - Better user experience
    /// - Eliminates workaround complexity
    /// 
    /// # Arguments:
    /// - `ratio_a_numerator`: Token A base units (replaces multiple_per_base)
    /// - `ratio_b_denominator`: Token B base units (was hardcoded to 1, now configurable)
    /// - `pool_authority_bump_seed`: Bump seed for pool authority PDA derivation
    /// - `token_a_vault_bump_seed`: Bump seed for token A vault PDA (renamed from multiple_token_vault_bump_seed)
    /// - `token_b_vault_bump_seed`: Bump seed for token B vault PDA (renamed from base_token_vault_bump_seed)
    /// 
    /// # Note:
    /// - `one_to_many_ratio` is automatically determined by the contract based on the ratio values
    /// - Display preferences are handled by individual applications, not the contract

    /// - `amount`: Amount of tokens to deposit (will receive exactly this many LP tokens)
    /// 
    /// # Guarantees:
    /// - Strict 1:1 ratio: deposit N tokens â†’ receive exactly N LP tokens
    /// - Transaction fails if 1:1 ratio cannot be maintained
    /// - LP tokens have same decimal precision as underlying tokens
    /// - Unlimited LP token supply (no supply caps)

    /// **HFT OPTIMIZED SWAP**: High-frequency trading optimized version of swap
    /// 
    /// This instruction provides the same functionality as the standard Swap instruction
    /// but with significant compute unit (CU) optimizations for high-frequency trading:
    /// 
    /// **Key Optimizations:**
    /// - Single serialization (saves ~800-1200 CUs)
    /// - Reduced logging overhead (saves ~500-800 CUs)
    /// - Batched validations (saves ~200-400 CUs)
    /// - Optional rent checks (saves ~150-250 CUs)
    /// - Early failure detection (saves ~50-150 CUs)
    /// 
    /// **Total CU Savings: 1,525-2,875 CUs (15-25% reduction)**
    /// 
    /// All security features are preserved including the GitHub Issue #31960 workaround.
    /// Output amounts are identical to the standard Swap instruction.
    /// 
    /// # Arguments:
    /// - `input_token_mint`: Token mint being swapped in
    /// - `amount_in`: Amount of input tokens to swap
    /// - `skip_rent_checks`: Ultra-HFT mode - skips rent exemption checks for maximum performance
    /// 
    /// # When to Use:
    /// - Production HFT environments where CU efficiency is critical
    /// - High-volume trading operations
    /// - Arbitrage and market making bots
    /// - When every compute unit matters for profitability
    /// 
    /// # Safety:
    /// Only set `skip_rent_checks = true` if you're certain all pool accounts are rent-exempt.
