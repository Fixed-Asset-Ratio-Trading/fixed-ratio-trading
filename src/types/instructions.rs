    /// **CRITICAL**: Program-level initialization (MUST BE CALLED FIRST)
    /// 
    /// This instruction must be called once when the program is first deployed.
    /// It creates all the system-level infrastructure that individual pools depend on.
    /// 
    /// # What it creates:
    /// 1. SystemState PDA - Global pause controls and system authority
    /// 2. MainTreasury PDA - Pool creation and liquidity operation fees
    /// 3. SwapTreasury PDA - Regular swap fees (high frequency)
    /// 
    /// # When to call:
    /// - ONCE during initial program deployment
    /// - Before any pools can be created
    /// - Before any other program operations
    /// 
    /// # After this initialization:
    /// - Pool creation will have treasury PDAs to send fees to
    /// - System pause functionality will be available
    /// - Treasury management operations will work
    /// - All subsequent operations will assume these PDAs exist
    /// 
    /// # Arguments:
    /// - System authority is provided via accounts[0] (must be signer)
    /// - The signer's pubkey will control system-wide operations
    ///   (pause/unpause system, withdraw treasury funds, etc.)
    /// 
    /// # Security:
    /// - Can only be called once (fails if SystemState already exists)
    /// - Creates all accounts as PDAs owned by the program
    /// - Sets up proper rent exemption for all accounts
    InitializeProgram {
        // No fields needed - system authority comes from accounts[0]
    },

    /// **RECOMMENDED**: Single-instruction pool initialization
    /// 
    /// This instruction provides a single, atomic operation for pool creation.
    /// 
    /// # What it does:
    /// - Creates Pool State PDA with correct size allocation
    /// - Creates LP token mints and transfers authority to pool
    /// - Creates token vault PDAs and initializes them
    /// - Initializes pool state data with all configuration
    /// - Transfers registration fees
    /// 
    /// # Benefits:
    /// - Atomic operation (all-or-nothing)
    /// - Simpler client integration
    /// - Better user experience
    /// - Eliminates workaround complexity
    /// 
    /// # Arguments:
    /// - `ratio_a_numerator`: Token A base units (replaces multiple_per_base)
    /// - `ratio_b_denominator`: Token B base units (was hardcoded to 1, now configurable)
    /// 
    /// # Note:
    /// - `one_to_many_ratio` is automatically determined by the contract based on the ratio values
    /// - Display preferences are handled by individual applications, not the contract

    /// # Guarantees:
    /// - Strict 1:1 ratio: deposit N tokens â†’ receive exactly N LP tokens

    /// - LP tokens have same decimal precision as underlying tokens
    /// - Unlimited LP token supply (no supply caps)
