## Overview

The Fixed Ratio Trading Contract is a Solana smart contract that enables creation and management of fixed-ratio trading pools. This document provides a comprehensive API reference for developers integrating with the contract.

### Key Features
- Fixed ratio token trading pools
- Liquidity provision with LP tokens
- Configurable fees per pool
- Emergency pause mechanisms
- Treasury management
- Owner-only swap restrictions

---

## Important Notes

### ðŸš¨ Critical Information

1. **ALL VALUES ARE IN BASIS POINTS**
   - Token amounts, ratios, and calculations use basis points (smallest unit of precision)
   - Example: 1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 basis points (lamports)
   - Example: 1 USDC = 1,000,000 basis points (6 decimals)

2. **Client Responsibilities**
   - Convert display values to basis points before calling any function
   - Fetch token decimals from mint accounts for accurate conversions
   - Validate inputs before submission

3. **Security**
   - Always validate PDAs against expected addresses
   - Check system and pool pause states before operations
   - Ensure proper signer authorities

---
