## Single-Instruction Pool Initialization

### **NEW: Single-Instruction Pool Initialization**
We've implemented a major improvement that replaces the deprecated two-instruction pattern with a modern single-instruction approach.

#### **Before (Deprecated):**
```rust
// Required 2 separate transactions
let create_ix = PoolInstruction::CreatePoolStateAccount { /* ... */ };
let init_ix = PoolInstruction::InitializePoolData { /* ... */ };
// Send transaction 1, then transaction 2
```

#### **After (Recommended):**
```rust
// Single atomic transaction
let init_ix = PoolInstruction::InitializePool { /* ... */ };
// Send single transaction ✅
```

#### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Atomic Operation**: All-or-nothing execution prevents partial states
- ✅ **Simpler Integration**: Single instruction call vs. two separate transactions  
- ✅ **Better UX**: Reduces transaction costs and complexity for users
- ✅ **Eliminates Race Conditions**: No possibility of partial pool creation
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Uses modern Solana best practices

## Client SDK

### **NEW: Client SDK**
Added a comprehensive client SDK that simplifies integration:

```rust
use fixed_ratio_trading::client_sdk::*;

// Create pool client
let pool_client = PoolClient::new(program_id);

// Configure pool
let pool_config = PoolConfig::new(usdc_mint, sol_mint, 1000)?; // 1000:1 ratio

// Get pool creation instruction (single atomic operation)
let create_ix = pool_client.create_pool_instruction(&payer, &pool_config, &lp_a_mint, &lp_b_mint)?;

// Add liquidity 
let deposit_ix = pool_client.deposit_instruction(&user, &pool_config, &usdc_mint, 1000000, &user_source, &user_lp)?;
```

#### **SDK Features:**
- 🔧 **Automatic PDA Derivation**: No manual address calculation needed
- 🔧 **Account Preparation**: Automatically prepares all required accounts
- 🔧 **Type Safety**: Strongly typed interfaces prevent common mistakes
- 🔧 **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and validation
- 🔧 **Testing Support**: Built-in utilities for testing and debugging

## Enhanced Instructions

### **NEW: Enhanced Deposit Instructions**
Added `DepositWithFeatures` for advanced use cases:

```rust
let enhanced_deposit_ix = pool_client.deposit_with_features_instruction(
    &user,
    &pool_config,
    &token_mint,
    amount,
    minimum_lp_tokens_out, // Slippage protection
    custom_fee_recipient,   // Optional custom fee recipient
    &user_source,
    &user_lp,
)?;
```

#### **Features:**
- 🛡️ **Slippage Protection**: Minimum LP token guarantees
- 💰 **Custom Fee Recipients**: Flexible fee distribution
- 🔍 **Enhanced Validation**: Additional checks and error handling

## PDA Helper Utilities

### **NEW: PDA Helper Utilities**
Simplified PDA derivation with helper instructions:

```rust
// Get pool state PDA
let get_pda_ix = PoolInstruction::GetPoolStatePDA {
    multiple_token_mint: usdc_mint,
    base_token_mint: sol_mint,
    multiple_per_base: 1000,
};

// Get token vault PDAs
let get_vaults_ix = PoolInstruction::GetTokenVaultPDAs {
    pool_state_pda: pool_pda,
};
```

## Test-Specific View Instructions

### **NEW: Test-Specific View Instructions**
Easy access to pool state data for testing and debugging:

```rust
// Get comprehensive pool information
let pool_info_ix = PoolInstruction::GetPoolInfo;

// Get liquidity information
let liquidity_ix = PoolInstruction::GetLiquidityInfo;

// Get fee information
let fee_ix = PoolInstruction::GetFeeInfo;
```

#### **Provides:**
- 📊 **Pool State**: Comprehensive pool configuration data
- 💧 **Liquidity Info**: Token balances, exchange rates, TVL
- 💸 **Fee Info**: Fee rates, collected fees, available balances

## Owner-Only Operations

### **NEW: Owner-Only Operations**
Simplified owner-controlled operations with immediate effect:

```rust
// Owner changes swap fee rate (immediate effect)
let change_fee_ix = PoolInstruction::ChangeFee {
    new_fee_basis_points: 25 // 0.25% fee
};

// Owner withdraws pool fees (immediate effect)
let withdraw_fees_ix = PoolInstruction::WithdrawPoolFees {
    token_mint: usdc_mint,
    amount: 1000,
};

// Owner pauses swap operations (immediate effect)
let pause_swaps_ix = PoolInstruction::PausePoolSwaps;

// Owner unpauses swap operations (immediate effect)
let unpause_swaps_ix = PoolInstruction::UnpausePoolSwaps;
```

#### **Features:**
- ⚡ **Immediate Effect**: All operations take effect immediately
- 🔐 **Owner-Only**: Only the pool owner can perform these operations
- 🎯 **Swap-Only Impact**: Pool pause only affects swap operations (deposits/withdrawals continue normally)
- 💧 **MEV Protection**: Automatic temporary pause during large withdrawals (≥5% of pool)

#### **Architectural Simplification:**
- ✅ **No Time Delays**: Immediate execution of all owner operations
- 🔐 **Owner-Only**: Only the pool owner can perform these operations
- ✅ **Swap-Only Scope**: Deposits and withdrawals unaffected by pool pause
- ✅ **Direct Control**: Pool owner has immediate control over all operations

#### **Use Cases:**
- 🔒 **Security Response**: Immediate response to detected issues
- 💰 **Fee Management**: Direct control over fee rates and withdrawals
- ⚡ **Operational Control**: Immediate pause/unpause capabilities

## Backward Compatibility

### Legacy Pattern Support
The legacy two-instruction pattern is still supported but marked as deprecated:

```rust
// ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Still works but not recommended
PoolInstruction::CreatePoolStateAccount { /* ... */ }
PoolInstruction::InitializePoolData { /* ... */ }

// ✅ RECOMMENDED - Use this instead
PoolInstruction::InitializePool { /* ... */ }
```

## Testing Improvements

### Enhanced Test Coverage
Run the comprehensive test suite including new single-instruction pattern tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run only new pattern tests
cargo test test_initialize_pool_new_pattern
cargo test test_helper_functions_new_pattern

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

#### **Test Coverage:**
- ✅ **21 tests passing** - Complete functionality coverage
- ✅ **Legacy pattern tests** - Ensures backward compatibility
- ✅ **New pattern tests** - Validates improvements
- ✅ **Helper utility tests** - Verifies SDK functionality
- ✅ **Integration tests** - End-to-end validation

## Performance Improvements
