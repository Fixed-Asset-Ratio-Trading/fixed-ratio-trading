## Testing Philosophy & Bug Fix Policy

### Core Principles:
- **High Priority First**: Critical business logic with 0% coverage
- **Sequential Implementation**: One test at a time with developer approval
- **Continuous Improvement**: Update plan based on discoveries
- **Clear Progress Tracking**: Visible milestones and completion status

### 🔧 CONTRACT BUG FIX POLICY:
**When tests reveal bugs in the contract code, we fix the contract rather than work around issues, since the contract is not yet deployed.**

- ✅ **Fix contract bugs immediately** when discovered during testing
- ✅ **Update all affected tests** after contract fixes
- ✅ **Document fixes** in the testing plan progress notes
- ❌ **No workarounds** - ensure tests verify correct functionality
- ✅ **Test-driven fixes** - let good tests drive better contract code

### 📝 GIT COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT:
**All test completion commits must follow this exact format:**

```
test: Complete LIQ-XXX <description> - <summary of work done>
```

**Examples:**
- `test: Complete LIQ-004 zero amount deposit validation test - Add validation, implement test, update plan`
- `test: Complete LIQ-005 wrong token deposit validation test - Add test, update plan`
- `test: Complete LIQ-006 insufficient balance deposit validation test - Add test, update plan`

**Format Requirements:**
- Start with `test:` prefix
- Include the test ID (LIQ-XXX, FEE-XXX, etc.)
- Brief description of what the test validates
- Dash separator followed by summary of changes made

async fn test_name() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // 1. Setup test environment
    // 2. Create necessary accounts/mints
    // 3. Execute the function under test
    // 4. Assert expected outcomes
    // 5. Verify state changes
    Ok(())
}
```

### Success Criteria Per Test

## Continuous Improvement Process

### After Each Test Implementation:
1. **Run Coverage Analysis**: `cargo tarpaulin --verbose`
2. **Identify Additional Test Cases**: Review uncovered edge cases
3. **Update This Plan**: Add new tests if critical gaps discovered
4. **Developer Review**: Wait for approval before proceeding

### Quality Gates:
- Each test must pass individually
- No regression in existing tests
- Coverage increase measurable after each test
- Code review for test quality and completeness

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas (Require Extra Attention):
- **Financial calculations** in liquidity management
- **Authorization checks** in fee and delegate operations  
- **State consistency** across concurrent operations
- **Error handling** for invalid inputs

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Comprehensive boundary testing
- Negative test cases for all validations
- State verification after each operation
- Integration tests for critical workflows
