## Testing Philosophy & Bug Fix Policy

### Core Principles:
- **High Priority First**: Critical business logic with 0% coverage
- **Sequential Implementation**: One test at a time with developer approval
- **Continuous Improvement**: Update plan based on discoveries
- **Clear Progress Tracking**: Visible milestones and completion status

### 🔧 CONTRACT BUG FIX POLICY:
**When tests reveal bugs in the contract code, we fix the contract rather than work around issues, since the contract is not yet deployed.**

- ✅ **Fix contract bugs immediately** when discovered during testing
- ✅ **Update all affected tests** after contract fixes
- ✅ **Document fixes** in the testing plan progress notes
- ❌ **No workarounds** - ensure tests verify correct functionality
- ✅ **Test-driven fixes** - let good tests drive better contract code

### 📝 GIT COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT:
**All test completion commits must follow this exact format:**

```
test: Complete LIQ-XXX <description> - <summary of work done>
```

**Examples:**
- `test: Complete LIQ-004 zero amount deposit validation test - Add validation, implement test, update plan`
- `test: Complete LIQ-005 wrong token deposit validation test - Add test, update plan`
- `test: Complete LIQ-006 insufficient balance deposit validation test - Add test, update plan`

**Format Requirements:**
- Start with `test:` prefix
- Include the test ID (LIQ-XXX, FEE-XXX, etc.)
- Brief description of what the test validates
- Dash separator followed by summary of changes made

## Progress Overview
- Current Coverage: 51.32%
- Target Coverage: 85%+
- Total Tests Running: 76 passing tests
- Tests Completed in Phase 1: 19/20
- Estimated Timeline: 2-3 weeks
