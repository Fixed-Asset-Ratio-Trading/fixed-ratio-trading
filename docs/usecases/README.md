## üí° Combining Use Cases

Many of these use cases can be combined for even more powerful applications:

### **Enterprise + Migration**
- Use institutional infrastructure for large-scale token migrations
- Provide enterprise-grade migration services to other protocols

### **DAO Governance + Target Pricing**
- Create governance pools at strategic price points
- Enable governance participation only when tokens reach certain values

### **Micro-Denomination + Migration**
- Migrate to more user-friendly micro-denominated versions
- Improve user experience while upgrading protocol

### **Institutional + Arbitrage**
- Enterprise arbitrage operations with guaranteed profit margins
- Institutional-scale stablecoin arbitrage with fixed spreads

## üéØ Innovation Opportunities

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Cross-Chain Bridges**: Fixed-ratio bridges between blockchain networks
- **Synthetic Assets**: Create synthetic exposure to assets at fixed ratios
- **Insurance Products**: Fixed-ratio insurance payouts and premium collections
- **Gaming Economies**: In-game token exchanges with predictable rates

### Future Developments
- **Multi-Token Pools**: Fixed ratios between 3+ tokens simultaneously
- **Time-Based Ratios**: Ratios that change predictably over time
- **Conditional Ratios**: Ratios triggered by external events or oracles
- **Governance-Controlled Ratios**: Community-managed ratio adjustments
