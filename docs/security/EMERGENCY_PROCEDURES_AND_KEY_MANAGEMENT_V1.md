# Emergency Procedures and Key Management - Version 1

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** Aug 4, 2025  
**Status:** Active  
**Controller:** DAVINCI CODES SOFTWARE DESIGN L.L.C (Establishment No: 1371744)  
**Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL - Internal Use Only

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the emergency procedures and key management protocols for the Fixed Ratio Trading smart contract during the initial operational phase (V1). During this phase, DAVINCI CODES SOFTWARE DESIGN L.L.C maintains sole control of the contract with plans to transition to a decentralized governance model upon reaching specified milestones.

## Key Management Infrastructure

### Security Architecture

```
Internet
    ↓
NAT Gateway (Primary)
    ↓
Internal Network
    ↓
NAT Gateway (Secondary)
    ↓
Isolated VM Host
    ↓
Secure Virtual Machine
    - Admin Control Application
    - Encrypted Key Storage
```

### Key Storage Protocol

1. **Primary Storage**
   - **Location**: Secure Virtual Machine on isolated host
   - **Network**: Double NAT protection (VM host behind NAT, network behind NAT)
   - **Access**: Single authorized person only
   - **Physical Location**: Undisclosed secure facility

2. **Backup Storage**
   - **VM Backup**: Stored WITHOUT keys
   - **Key File**: Encrypted and stored in safety deposit box
   - **Owner**: DAVINCI CODES SOFTWARE DESIGN L.L.C
   - **Encryption**: Standard encryption requiring password only
   - **Password Holder**: Designated trustee of DAVINCI CODES SOFTWARE DESIGN L.L.C

3. **Access Credentials**
   - **VM Access**: Password-protected
   - **Key Decryption**: Separate password
   - **Distribution**: 3 bonded company employees

## Authorized Personnel

### Bonded Employees
Three (3) bonded employees are authorized with equal permissions:
1. Employee 1: [Name withheld - stored separately]
2. Employee 2: [Name withheld - stored separately]
3. Employee 3: [Name withheld - stored separately]

### Access Rights
All three employees have equal authority to:
- Access the secure VM
- Decrypt key files
- Execute emergency procedures
- Perform treasury operations
- Pause/unpause pools or system

### Password Management
- **VM Access Password**: Shared among 3 employees
- **Key Decryption Password**: Shared among 3 employees
- **Password Recovery**: Via email verification code
- **Password Changes**: Allowed through in-app recovery process
- **Rotation Schedule**: None required

## Integration with Monitoring System

### Alert Code System
All emergency actions require valid alert codes from the monitoring system:

1. **Alert Code Structure**
   - Embedded timestamp
   - Operation type identifier
   - Checksum validation
   - Unique alert ID

2. **Alert Types and Permissions**
   ```
   POOL_PANIC_XXXX     → Can only pause specific pool
   WITHDRAWAL_ALERT_XXXX → Can only pause system
   TREASURY_NOTIFY_XXXX  → Informational only
   ```

3. **Code Validation**
   - System validates alert code before allowing action
   - Prevents cross-operation usage (pool codes can't pause system)
   - Ensures action matches alert type

## Emergency Response Procedures

### Alert Response Workflow

1. **Alert Reception**
   - Monitoring system detects anomaly
   - Pushover notification sent to all 3 employees
   - Alert includes specific code and details

2. **Team Coordination**
   - Employees communicate via group messenger
   - Decision made on who will respond
   - Responder acknowledges in group

3. **Action Execution**
   - Responder accesses secure VM
   - Enters alert code from monitoring system
   - Executes appropriate action
   - Confirms completion to team

### Specific Alert Responses

#### 1. Pool Out of Sync Alert (POOL_PANIC)
**Trigger**: Pool ratio deviation or deposit/swap mismatch
**Action**: 
- Pause affected pool only
- Input: `POOL_PANIC_XXXX` code
- System prevents pausing other pools or system

#### 2. Unauthorized Treasury Withdrawal (Outside Window)
**Trigger**: Treasury withdrawal outside 1st-3rd GMT
**Action**:
- Immediate system pause
- Input: `WITHDRAWAL_ALERT_XXXX` code
- Notify all stakeholders

#### 3. Authorized Treasury Withdrawal (Inside Window)
**Trigger**: Treasury withdrawal within 1st-3rd GMT
**Action**:
- Monitor and log
- No pause required unless suspicious
- Can still pause with withdrawal alert code if needed

### Public Communication

1. **Outage Notification**
   - Post to Twitter/X: @davincij15
   - Include: Nature of issue, expected resolution time
   - No technical details that could aid attackers

2. **Resolution Updates**
   - Regular updates every 2-4 hours
   - Final resolution announcement
   - Post-mortem if appropriate

## Treasury Operations

### Withdrawal Schedule
- **Allowed Window**: 1st, 2nd, 3rd of each month (GMT)
- **Timing**: Internally decided within window
- **Documentation**: Not required for timing decisions
- **Executor**: Any of the 3 authorized employees

### Fee Collection Process
1. Any authorized employee can initiate
2. Must be within allowed window
3. Follow standard VM access procedures
4. Complete transaction
5. Notify other team members

## Operational Procedures

### Daily Operations
1. **Monitoring Review**
   - Check monitoring system status
   - Review any overnight alerts
   - Verify system health

2. **Communication Check**
   - Confirm all employees reachable
   - Test group messenger weekly
   - Verify Pushover delivery

### Emergency Escalation

#### Level 1: Standard Alert
- Single employee responds
- Follow standard procedures
- Update team on resolution

#### Level 2: Critical Issue
- All employees notified
- Group decision on response
- Consider system-wide pause

#### Level 3: Catastrophic Failure
- Immediate system pause
- All hands response
- Contact: support@davincicodes.net
- Engage external support if needed

## Security Protocols

### Access Security
1. **Never** share passwords outside authorized group
2. **Never** access VM from public networks
3. **Always** verify alert codes before action
4. **Always** confirm actions with team

### Operational Security
1. No discussion of procedures in public
2. Secure communication channels only
3. Regular security awareness training
4. Incident reporting mandatory

## Documentation Requirements

### Alert Response Documentation
- **Required**: Copy of monitoring system notification
- **Storage**: With action logs on secure system
- **Retention**: Indefinite
- **Access**: Authorized personnel only

### Action Logging
Each emergency action must log:
- Alert code used
- Action taken
- Timestamp
- Employee identifier
- Result confirmation

## Future Improvements

As TVL increases, the following improvements will be implemented:

### Near-term (< $1M TVL)
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- Additional alert types
- Refined response procedures

### Medium-term ($1M - $10M TVL)
- Additional security layers
- Expanded employee team
- 24/7 coverage consideration

### Long-term (> $10M TVL)
- Transition to governance model
- Decentralized control
- Professional security team

## Recovery Procedures

### Password Recovery
1. **Process**: Email verification code
2. **Authority**: Any bonded employee
3. **New Password**: Set through app
4. **Notification**: Inform other employees

### System Recovery
- **VM Failure**: Restore from backup, re-add keys
- **Key Loss**: Use safety deposit box copy
- **Network Issues**: Fallback connection available
