# Future Governance Contract Design - Fixed Ratio Trading

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Entity:** DAVINCI CODES SOFTWARE DESIGN L.L.C (Establishment No: 1371744)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the future governance contract that will control the Fixed Ratio Trading smart contract. The governance model will transition from single-entity control to a decentralized multisig-based system with role-based permissions. The transition will occur after specific revenue milestones or accelerated payment triggers are met.

## Transition Timeline

### Activation Triggers
The governance contract will be developed and deployed when ONE of the following conditions is met:
1. **Revenue Milestone**: Fixed Ratio Trading contract earns or receives 1,500 SOL in donations/revenue
2. **Acceleration Payment**: Receipt of $50,000 USD payment (contact: info@davincicodes.net)

### Current Phase (V1)
- **Controller**: DAVINCI CODES SOFTWARE DESIGN L.L.C
- **Management**: Direct control via secure key management system
- **Duration**: Until activation triggers are met

### Transition Phase
- Development and testing of governance contract on testnet
- Gradual migration of control functions
- New operational procedures developed post-mainnet deployment

## Governance Architecture

### Core Design Principles
1. **Modular Permission System**: Different functions controlled by different account groups
2. **Timelock Controls**: Critical operations subject to delay periods
3. **Transparency**: All governance actions publicly visible on-chain
4. **Non-Custodial**: Governance controls operations but never holds user funds

### Permission Structure

#### 1. Critical Operations (2-of-3 Multisig Required)
- **Treasury Withdrawals**
  - Requires 2-of-3 signatures
  - Subject to timelock delay (48-72 hours)
  - Withdrawal windows enforced (1st-3rd of month GMT)
  
- **Program Upgrades**
  - Requires 2-of-3 signatures
  - Uses Timelock Upgrade Controller pattern
  - Minimum 72-hour delay for review
  - Cancelable during delay period

#### 2. Pool Management Operations
- **Pool Pause/Unpause**
  - Controlled by one or more designated accounts
  - Immediate execution for emergency response
  - Requires monitoring system alert code
  
#### 3. System Management Operations
- **System Pause/Unpause**
  - Controlled by one or more designated accounts
  - Immediate execution for critical issues
  - Requires monitoring system alert code

#### 4. Maintenance Operations
- **Consolidation**
  - Controlled by one or more designated accounts
  - No timelock required
  - Executed during maintenance windows

### Upgrade Controller Integration

The governance contract will implement a modified version of the Timelock Upgrade Controller with these features:

```
Timelock Upgrade Controller (Non-Upgradeable)
    ↓
Governance Contract (Upgradeable via timelock)
    ↓
Fixed Ratio Trading Contract (Upgradeable via timelock)
```

#### Upgrade Process
1. **Propose**: Submit upgrade hash with 2-of-3 multisig
2. **Review**: 72-hour public review period
3. **Cancel**: Option to cancel if issues discovered
4. **Execute**: Apply upgrade after timelock expires

### Account Structure

```yaml
Governance Accounts:
  Critical Multisig:
    - Signer 1: [To be designated]
    - Signer 2: [To be designated]
    - Signer 3: [To be designated]
    - Threshold: 2 of 3
    
  Pool Managers:
    - Account 1: [To be designated]
    - Account 2+: [Optional additional accounts]
    
  System Managers:
    - Account 1: [To be designated]
    - Account 2+: [Optional additional accounts]
    
  Consolidation Operators:
    - Account 1: [To be designated]
    - Account 2+: [Optional additional accounts]
```

## Governance Evolution

### Version 2 - Enhanced Controls
- Add more granular permission controls
- Implement operation-specific timelocks
- Enhanced monitoring integration
- Automated compliance reporting

### Version 3 - Token-Based Governance
- **Governance Token**: Details to be determined
- **Voting Mechanisms**: 
  - Parameter adjustments
  - Feature additions
  - Emergency response protocols
- **Token Distribution**: To be designed based on ecosystem growth
- **Voting Power**: Model to be determined (linear, quadratic, etc.)

## Security Features

### 1. Alert Code Integration
- All pause operations require valid monitoring system alert codes
- Alert codes include:
  - Timestamp embedding
  - Checksum validation
  - Operation-type matching (pool vs system alerts)

### 2. Operation Restrictions
- Pool alert codes can only pause specific pools
- System alert codes required for system-wide pause
- Withdrawal alert codes trigger immediate system halt capability

### 3. Transparency Measures
- All governance actions emit detailed events
- Public proposal queue visible on-chain
- Emergency actions posted to Twitter (@davincij15 initially)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Contract Development
1. Design detailed governance contract architecture
2. Implement core multisig functionality
3. Integrate Timelock Upgrade Controller
4. Add role-based permission system

### Phase 2: Testing & Audit
1. Comprehensive test suite development
2. Testnet deployment and testing
3. Security audit by reputable firm
4. Community review period

### Phase 3: Deployment
1. Mainnet contract deployment
2. Authority transfer from LLC to governance
3. Update operational procedures
4. Train designated signers/operators

### Phase 4: Enhancement
1. Monitor operational efficiency
2. Implement V2 features based on usage
3. Plan V3 token governance transition
4. Continuous improvement cycle

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Gradual Transition
- Extensive testing before authority transfer
- Parallel operation period if needed
- Rollback procedures documented

### 2. Emergency Procedures
- Break-glass access maintained during transition
- Clear escalation paths
- 24/7 monitoring coverage

### 3. Legal Compliance
- Governance structure reviewed by legal counsel
- Regulatory compliance maintained
- Clear liability frameworks
