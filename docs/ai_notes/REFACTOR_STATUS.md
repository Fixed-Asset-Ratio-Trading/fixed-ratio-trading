# Refactoring Status and Continuation Guide

## Recent Changes Made

### 1. Cooldown System Removal
- Removed cooldown-based withdrawal security in favor of delegate-based two-step process
- Updated documentation to reflect this architectural change
- Removed cooldown-related code from:
  - `src/error.rs`: Removed `WithdrawalCooldown` error variant
  - `src/types/instructions.rs`: Removed `withdrawal_cooldown` parameter
  - `src/lib.rs`: Updated instruction processing
  - `src/processors/security.rs`: Removed cooldown documentation and parameters
  - `tests/test_security.rs`: Removed cooldown-related tests

### 2. Testing Plan Updates
- Updated `docs/tests/COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_PLAN.md`
- Changed LIQ-009 from cooldown test to delegate process test
- Added detailed test requirements for two-step withdrawal process

### 3. Constants Updates
- Added `MAX_PENDING_ACTIONS` constant in `src/constants.rs`
- Updated `MAX_DELEGATES` from 10 to 3
- Added `MINIMUM_RENT_BUFFER` constant

### 4. Pool State Updates
- Updated error handling in `src/types/pool_state.rs`
- Changed `TooManyPendingActions` to `MaxPendingActionsReached`
- Added proper message logging

## Current Issues to Fix

### 1. Test Files Compilation Errors

#### a. test_liquidity_management.rs
- Variable reference issues:
  ```rust
  let (user, _user_primary_token_account, _user_base_token_account) = setup_test_user(...)
  ```
  - Need to remove underscore from `_user_primary_token_account` where it's used
  - Locations: lines 790, 1976
  - Used in lines: 803, 805, 1989, 1991

#### b. test_security.rs
1. Import Issues:
   - Missing `TestContext` type
   - Unused imports to remove:
     - `clock::Clock`
     - `rent::Rent`
     - `system_instruction`
     - `ProgramTest`
     - `transport::TransportError`
     - `error::PoolError`
     - `types::pool_state::PoolState`

2. Type Mismatches:
   - `create_test_pool` return type mismatch:
     ```rust
     async fn create_test_pool(ctx: &mut TestContext, owner: &Keypair) -> TestResult<Pubkey>
     ```
     Should be:
     ```rust
     async fn create_test_pool(ctx: &mut TestContext, owner: &Keypair) -> TestResult
     ```

3. Function Call Issues:
   - `update_security_params` calls have mismatched types
   - Expected `&Pubkey`, found `&()`
   - Affects multiple test cases

## Next Steps

1. Fix test_liquidity_management.rs:
   - Remove underscores from used variables
   - Add underscores to actually unused variables
   - Verify all variable references are correct

2. Fix test_security.rs:
   - Add correct imports
   - Fix return type of `create_test_pool`
   - Fix type mismatches in `update_security_params` calls
   - Remove unused imports

3. Verify Changes:
   - Run tests again after fixes
   - Check for any new warnings or errors
   - Ensure all tests pass

4. Continue Implementation:
   - Move on to implementing the next test in the plan
   - Focus on delegate-based withdrawal security
   - Add comprehensive tests for the two-step process

## Important Notes

1. Architecture Change:
   - System now uses delegate-based two-step withdrawal process
   - No more cooldown periods
   - Security through delegation and owner approval

2. Testing Strategy:
   - Tests should focus on delegate actions
   - Verify proper authorization checks
   - Ensure state consistency throughout the process

3. Code Organization:
   - Keep test files organized and consistent
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns
   - Follow established patterns for new tests

## Continuation Instructions

When continuing this work:
1. Start with fixing compilation errors in test files
2. Run tests after each fix to verify
3. Once tests pass, continue with implementing new tests
4. Follow the updated testing plan in COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_PLAN.md
5. Maintain the delegate-based security model throughout

## Current Test Coverage Status
- Phase 1: 6/20 tests completed
- Current Coverage: 28.11%
- Target Coverage: 85%+
- Next Test to Implement: LIQ-009 (delegate process test)
