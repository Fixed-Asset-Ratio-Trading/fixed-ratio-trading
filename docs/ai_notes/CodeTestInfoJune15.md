Now let me run the code coverage analysis. For Rust projects, we'll use `cargo tarpaulin` which is a popular code coverage tool, or `grcov` if available.
```bash
cd /Users/davinci/code/Fixed && cargo tarpaulin --version
```

```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

Now let me run a quick test to make sure the tests work, then run the code coverage analysis:
```bash
cargo test --verbose
```

Excellent! All tests are passing. Now let me run the code coverage analysis:
```bash
cargo tarpaulin --verbose --all-features --workspace --timeout 120 --out Html --output-dir target/tarpaulin-reports
```

Perfect! The code coverage analysis has completed. Let me check the HTML report that was generated and also analyze the test files to give you a comprehensive overview.

Let me also look at some of the test files to understand what's currently being tested:
Read file: tests/test_swaps.rs

Now let me also check what methods are currently tested vs untested by examining the processors:
Read file: src/processors/mod.rs

Let me look at the function definitions to get a complete picture:

**Total Test Count: 56 tests passing**
- Pool Creation: 10 tests
- Utilities: 18 tests  
- Fees: 9 tests
- Delegates: 8 tests
- Security: 8 tests
- Swaps: 2 tests
- Library: 1 test

The project has good foundational test coverage for pool creation and utilities, but needs significant expansion in core business logic areas like liquidity management, fee handling, and the client SDK.
